1. ok login as user (email, password)
1. ok create a consent 
1. ok see all my running kosents

1. validation of email and password (and other forms)
1. show the potential proposers for everybody  
1. Confirm dialog for "delete"
1. List and current konsent in one page  

--> BETA 1

1. make backwards / forward buttons functional (list of k / current k in one page)
1. archive konsents - but show them below the "active list"
1. have an archive button in the active list. have an delete button in the archived list.
1. use an invitation link to take part in an konsent without registration
1. validate a users email-adress by clicking an email-link
1. make an change your password.
1. make an "forgot your password"

1. have german law imprint  
1. UNDO (see functional tv)
1. notifications (changes indicators - in the sense of "waiting for you")
1. Profile-pictures (round)
1. make it like a chat application

## nice to have and later
1. change email adress


## technical issues / refactoring / improvements
1. roles (validated, authenticated, known-guest, anonymous)  
for different api functions (login, save-konsent, ...)   
1. tests of all routes
1. all data as subscription (especially the "active konsent")
1. remove error after 20 seconds
1. ok provide a websocket notify api that is easy to implement in other languages: json  
   ok {"id" 17}
1. provide spec for API (swagger)
1. provide spec for konsent data 
1. UUID as user id - email as parameter
1. make the invitations an own field in konsent (id konsent invitations)  
   that way, it would be save from beeing manipulated by clients.
1. sdfsdf
